## Steps:

1. Add your JDK Home Path to VSCode Settings by opening your VSCode workspace and pressing `Ctrl+,`.  Then type `java.home` and hit `Enter`.

2. In your `"java.home"` setting, add the java-11 jdk path which is most likely `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11` for CS Machines.

3. Restart VSCode and run your respective configured launch (usually by pressing `F5`).
